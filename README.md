# Arduino Temperature Alert System

This project is an embedded system using Arduino.  
It reads the temperature from a sensor, and when the temperature exceeds a certain limit, an LED lights up and a buzzer sounds to alert the user.  
The current temperature is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno  
- Temperature sensor (TMP36)  
- 16x2 LCD display  
- LED  
- Buzzer  
- Connecting wires
- BreadBoard

## How It Works

1. The temperature sensor continuously measures the surrounding temperature.  
2. The Arduino reads the sensor data and displays the temperature on the LCD screen.  
3. If the temperature goes above the set threshold, the LED turns on and the buzzer sounds as an alert.

## How to Use

- Connect all components as shown in the project.  
- Upload the provided Arduino code (`temperature_alert.ino`) to your Arduino board.  
- Power on the system and monitor the temperature on the LCD.  
- When the temperature exceeds the limit, observe the LED and buzzer alerts.
